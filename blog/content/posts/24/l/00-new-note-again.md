Create a new note again in a new static blog.

<!--more-->

Today, I am aged oficially and get uncomfortable again, which triggers me  to create a new blog for my future notes.

Lessons learned from [pasir](https://dudung.github.io/pasir) are only few as follow

1. Filename naming convention is `yy/m/nn-note-abbrv-name.md` and link to this note is `24k00`, where `yy=24` for `2024`, `m=k` for `Dec`, and `00` for the first note. \
`a=Jan`, `b=Feb`, `c=Mar`, `d=Apr`, `e=May`, `f=Jun`, `g=Jul`, `h=Aug`, `i=Sep`, `j=Oct`, `k=Nov`, `l=Dec`.
