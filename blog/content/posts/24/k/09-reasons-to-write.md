There are many excuses not to write, and there are also many reasons to write.

<!--more-->

Sketch:

This morning I try to start again consistently to write but in more non-formal way, on pasir instead on Medium, since here there will be no readers, so I can feel safe from critism, which I still can handle. It sounds weak, isn't it? Yesterday afternoon a friend sent a video related to writing  [^suhendra_2024], which is later traced back to [^philosophy_2017], where the original source is also available [^peterson_2017] with a quote

> The best way to teach people critical thinking is to teach them to write.

that means a lot to me. It is not related to the fact that I am part of working group whose task is to prepare Computational Thinking course for first year student in our university. And the question is: Can Computational Thinking also be taught in the same way of Critical Thinking? So it is not just essay, but certain essay that include the computational way in solving problems.

Let us back to critical thinking, where following paragraph

> Critical thinking is defined as the mental process of actively and skillfully perception, analysis, synthesis and evaluation of collected information through observation, experience and communication that leads to a decision for action. 

is a definition [^papathanasiou_2014] from other available definitions
